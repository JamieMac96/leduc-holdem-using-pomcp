# with three cards in each suit. There are two rounds. In the
# first round a single private card is dealt to each player. In
# the second round a single board card is revealed. There is
# a two-bet maximum, with raise amounts of 2 and 4 in the
# first and second round, respectively. Both players start the
# first round with 1 already in the pot

# f = fold
# b = bet
# C = call
